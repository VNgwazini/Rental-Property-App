We will\n                  force landlords to make their offers solely on the\n                  criteria that should matter. After we complete your Fake\n                  Brochure, landlords will be barking at the bit to bid on\n                  you.\n                </p>\n              </Row>\n            </Col>\n          </Row>\n          <Row className=\"why-Rectangle text-left my-4 mx-auto\">\n            <Col lg=\"2\">\n              <div className=\"text-center why-rent-image-align col-lg-12 col-md-10\">\n                <img\n                  src=\"/img/009-chat.png\"\n                  alt=\"009-chat.png\"\n                  className=\"img-fluid img-thumbnail remove-icon-outline\"\n                />\n              </div>\n            </Col>\n            <Col lg=\"10\" className=\"mt-4\">\n              <Row>\n                <h6>\n                  Discover more apartments and pay less for applications.\n                </h6>\n              </Row>\n              <Row>\n                <p>\n                  Until now, tenants could not discover or compare flexible\n                  rental pricing without contacting multiple landlords and\n                  paying multiple application fees.
