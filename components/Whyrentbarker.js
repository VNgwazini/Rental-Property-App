                  Did you know landlords have pricing flexibility based upon
                  factors such as vacancy rates, your desired lease date and
                  term, and your personal qualifications and history? It
                  often requires skilled negotiation to achieve a landlord’s
                  best rate because this information is constantly changing,
                  which can be stressful and time consuming. FakeCompany
                  flips the script, promoting your unique qualifications to
                  landlords to compel them to chase you and make you their
                  best offer, without stressful negotiations.

                  great job, make car payments on time, or have a spotless
                  record, we will create a Fake Brochure that highlights
                  your best qualities to demonstrate to landlords that you
                  are the tenant they want. Your Fake Brochure will not
                  disclose your name, race, color, national origin,
                  religion, sex, familial status, or any disability. We will
                  force landlords to make their offers solely on the
                  criteria that should matter. After we complete your Fake
                  Brochure, landlords will be barking at the bit to bid on
                  you.

                  Until now, tenants could not discover or compare flexible
                  rental pricing without contacting multiple landlords and
                  paying multiple application fees. FakeCompany reverses the
                  process and ANONYMOUSLY advertises your unique
                  qualifications (credit, background, income, etc.) to
                  multiple landlords of your choosing, and in response,
                  landlords will make their best offer to you at the outset.
